SPACE TEXT ADVENTURE

JIST

Character deployed from orbiter, landing procedure fails, craft crashes, PARTLY BROKEN CAN BE REPAIRED, character recovers and then explores map to try and find a way to repair the ship and complete his primary mission, and then to escape the planet back to the orbiting ship.

Crashes in a crater
Finds objects in crater floor that point to a previous crash
Trail leads character to another wreckage that was sent to the planet some years ago, that contains a few of the parts needed to repair the ship
Along the way many objects and puzzles create ways for character to build other parts and aid his way to the other wreck site
Eventually once returned to the ship, has to solve puzzles to build the craft again and launch it
No battles, can't die, but many puzzles left behind to solve to learn about a race that once lived here but was made extinct (and ends up being humans before they came to earth)
